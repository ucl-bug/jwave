function test_angular_spectrum_cw(in_filename, plot_tests)
  % Function to generate k-Wave results compare j-Wave and k-Wave. The k-Wave
  % simulation is run for one extra time step, as j-Wave assigns p0 at the
  % beginning of the time loop, and k-Wave at the end.
  %
  % Arguments:
  % in_filename: name of the input file to setup the simulation
  % plot_tests: boolean to plot the results of the tests

  % This file is part of j-Wave.
